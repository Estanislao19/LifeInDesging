                        </h3>
                        <p class="questions__show">An SEO (Search Engine Optimization) agency specializes in improving a website’s visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). SEO agencies utilize a combination of technical optimization, content creation, and off-site strategies to enhance a website’s relevance and authority in the eyes of search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

                            Their goal is to increase organic traffic to the client’s website by targeting relevant keywords and phrases that potential customers are searching for. We also stay updated on search engine algorithm changes and industry trends to ensure our strategies remain effective and compliant with best practices.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p class="questions__show">It depends. Some companies have the budget and resources to hire an SEO analyst in-house. For businesses of all sizes, however, SEO is vital to driving growth and generating revenue. Often, organic search traffic is the most engaged, highest converting, and best performing marketing channels. So, hiring an agency that understands the intricacies of search engine algorithms has massive benefit for a brand’s bottom line.

                            Whether you need an agency or decide to hire internally, SEO is a channel that cannot be ignored for any modern business looking to compete. The world runs online and the starting point is search. Be sure your business is capturing relevant users as soon as they start their journey.</p>

                            Meet with a few SEO agencies to see where their processes and strategies overlap and where their SEO process is unique. Every business is unique and there is absolutely an SEO agency that can fit your needs.
                            
                            If you’re a novice in SEO, choose an agency that takes the time to explain the data and their process of analyzing your website. If you’re a veteran looking to offload the work, choose an SEO agency that is able to execute on the nitty-gritty technical aspects of websites. Luckily for you, we do both.</p>

                            That’s not the case with SEO. Much like going to the gym, with SEO, you get out what you put in. Skillful content creation, technical optimizations, and strategic keyword targeting all comes from the work of the agency or employee you hire. From there, you let the magical search algorithms do their work. If you do it well, you generate a consistent, FREE source of traffic to your website.</p>

                        <p class="questions__show">A web design agency is a specialized company that offers professional services related to the creation, development, and maintenance of websites. These agencies typically employ a team of experts with diverse skill sets, including web designers, developers, UX/UI designers, content creators, and project managers.

                            The primary role of a web design agency is to collaborate with clients to understand their goals, target audience, and branding requirements. Based on this understanding, the agency works to design and develop custom websites that effectively represent the client’s brand identity while meeting the needs of their audience.
                            
                            Web design agencies provide a range of services, including website design and development, responsive design for mobile compatibility, e-commerce solutions, content management system (CMS) integration, search engine optimization (SEO), and ongoing maintenance and support.</p>

                        <p class="questions__show">We’ve worked on them all. Shopify, Wix, WebFlow, Drupal, Squarespace, and WordPress (plus a few other ones).

                            Our best recommendation for choosing a platform for your website is to determine the biggest feature you want you website to perform.
                            
                            Shopify, for example, has pre-built checkout features and easy tracking and managing of inventory. It’s build for e-commerce companies, but the design features of Shopify are very limited.
                            
                            Wix allows you to drag and drop design elements throughout your website. Making it easy to create unique designs and features to build a beautiful site. However, functionality and intuitive SEO are difficult features in Wix.
                            
                            Our preference is always WordPress. The platform has a plethora of plug-ins that allow you to build customizations that can exactly tailor to your business. However, the backend of WordPress is not for the web novices. If you’re looking to frequently update your own site, and aren’t great with computers, WordPress is a bit of a learning curve.</p>

Having a beautiful site is great, but if no one finds it, or worse yet, it doesn’t improve your business, then it’s essentially money down the drain.

                        <p class="questions__show">A good website effectively balances several key elements to provide an exceptional user experience and achieve its intended purpose. Here are some factors that contribute to making a website good:

                            Responsive Design: It adapts seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience for users on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
                            
                            High-Quality Content: It provides valuable, relevant, and engaging content that meets the needs of the target audience, establishing credibility and encouraging repeat visits.
                            
                            Visual Appeal: A visually appealing design with high-quality imagery, cohesive color schemes, and attractive typography enhances the overall user experience and reflects the brand identity.
                            
                            Easy Navigation: Intuitive navigation with clear menus, breadcrumbs, and internal linking helps users find what they’re looking for quickly and efficiently.
                            
                            Analytics and Testing: Continuous monitoring, analysis, and testing allow website owners to identify areas for improvement and optimize performance based on user feedback and behavior.
                            
                            Your website is a living, breathing part of your business. It should always been tweaked and improved. A stale website is clear to see to any consumer.</p>

                            That cost is spread out over a set number of months while we strategize, develop, and launch your site.
                            
                            Pricing depends on the size of the website, the amount of content needed to be written, and the amount of new design hours required to bring your vision to life!</p>
